 Portfolio Artifacts

This submission includes critical components from two projects that demonstrate my ability to write functional Java code and implement comprehensive unit tests:

- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`
- `Final-Project-Two-Report-Tariq Mack.docx`

Together, these files reflect my understanding of unit testing, validation, input control, and thoughtful testing strategies in backend development.

 Reflection

 How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Functionality and security were core priorities in both projects. I ensured functionality by writing JUnit test cases for every core feature using techniques such as boundary testing, exception handling, and input validation. For example, I checked for valid and invalid contact IDs, null names, and phone number formatting. On the security side, I enforced rules at the object creation level, rejecting invalid inputs early. This proactive approach mitigates vulnerabilities and enhances code robustness.

 How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpreted user needs by examining the business and technical requirements provided in Project One. These needs included constraints like ID length, non-null fields, and structured phone numbers. I transformed these needs into validation logic within the service classes and then verified them through unit testing. The test cases reflected real user behaviors, both correct and erroneous, to make sure the software could handle real-world usage patterns.

 How do I approach designing software?

My design process begins with understanding requirements and visualizing how components interact. I structure code using modular principles, separating logic into manageable classes like `Contact` and `ContactService`. I then apply the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in testing and validate against both positive and negative scenarios. I follow disciplined testing practices to reduce technical debt and ensure long-term maintainability, integrating helper methods to avoid redundancy.
